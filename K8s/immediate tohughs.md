- So since we have kubernetes cluster, the pods that we create, and the ip addresses attached to it, how do we access them? and what is their ip ranges? their cidr ranges?
in a production environment, if i have a subnet or a vpc inside which my cluster remains, is it possible that the pods will have ip addresses based on the cidr range or will it randomly allocated by some algot=rithm of its own?
