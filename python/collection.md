list and tuples


list:
![[Pasted image 20250424202917.png]]

we already knew append.
now we have:
![[Pasted image 20250424202949.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250424203002.png]]
it removes the last element


we can also specify which element to remove:
![[Pasted image 20250424203046.png]]



Important stuff:
if you copy, it stays copied till the end
![[Pasted image 20250424203157.png]]
see, even when we changed 'x' the 'y' also changed at the end.


but if we want to copy only the initial change:
![[Pasted image 20250424203239.png]]
add a colon.
