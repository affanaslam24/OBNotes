basic:

you can add arguments:

now, this time its returning a value:

if we return more than one, itll give us a tuple

fun thing about seperating the two return types is like this:

r1 and r2.



by having an optional argument:

A lil advance topic:
notice that the return func2 is outside of func2, which means we are returning the function2 from function1. what this does is:

if you just call the main func, itll give us the function object reference.

to print the func2, we would have to add func(3)(), to do that.
