now we start at 0 index, we wanna stop at 4th index, we are stepping 2.
therefore we got an output of 0th index, the 2nd index, but not the 4th index.


if we did- x= y[:],
then that meant start and stop at the full length.

if we did- x=y[:4]
then that meant stop before 4th index.

if we did - x=y[2:]
then we meant start at 2 and stop at end.
