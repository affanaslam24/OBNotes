it is mmutable:

split:
![[Pasted image 20250424184533.png]]

0, 1 , 2
but this will print a new list, not the old one. Basically, this doesnt changes our list.

![[Pasted image 20250424184622.png]]

list is also an objject, so it has functions as wlel


![[Pasted image 20250424184705.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250424184734.png]]

ALSO, list can take anything, it can have a mix of all the data types in one single list.

for loop:
![[Pasted image 20250424184918.png]]
1
2
3
4
5



for same as while:
![[Pasted image 20250424185001.png]]

RANGE:
![[Pasted image 20250424185042.png]]

this will give range(0,5) as our input

![[Pasted image 20250424185109.png]]
and this will print
0
1
2
3
4



to play with range you can do thus:
![[Pasted image 20250424185142.png]]

5
6
7
8
9



![[Pasted image 20250424185209.png]]
this will print by skipping 2 numbers
![[Pasted image 20250424185235.png]]


and tuple is a list but which is immutable!
