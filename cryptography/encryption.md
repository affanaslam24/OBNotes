public and provate keys are mathematically linked too each other in rsa algo

Even if you know th epubliuc, you cant derive the private key, but you can encrypt or decrypt objects from one of the other


how the assymetric works:

she encrypted with bobs public key, and this can only be decrypted using bobs proivate key.
