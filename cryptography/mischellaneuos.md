## 🌐 IP Sniffing

### 🔍 What is IP Sniffing?

**IP Sniffing** is the act of **intercepting and monitoring network packets** that travel across a network. It’s usually done using a **packet sniffer** tool.

- **Goal:** To capture sensitive data like usernames, passwords, or session tokens.
    
- **How:** Attackers put their network card in **promiscuous mode** to see all traffic on a network segment (common in LANs or unencrypted Wi-Fi).
    

### 📦 Tools Used:

- Wireshark
    
- tcpdump
    
- Ettercap
    

### ⚠️ Risk:

- Works well in **unencrypted** or **poorly secured** networks.
    
- Cannot be easily detected by users unless proper monitoring is in place.

## 🎭 IP Spoofing

### 🤖 What is IP Spoofing?

**IP Spoofing** is the act of **forging the source IP address** of a packet to make it appear as if it came from a trusted source.

- **Goal:** To bypass security filters, impersonate another device, or launch **DDoS**, **MITM**, or **session hijacking** attacks.
    
- **How:** Attackers modify packet headers before sending them.
    

### 🛠️ Tools Used:

- hping
    
- Scapy
    
- Nemesis
    

### ⚠️ Risk:

- Dangerous in systems that **trust IP addresses** (e.g., firewall rules).
    
- Often used in **SYN Flood DDoS** attacks.

## 🧠 Real-World Examples

### 📡 IP Sniffing:

- Capturing unencrypted credentials from public Wi-Fi.
    
- Analyzing HTTP traffic to find session cookies.
    

### 🎭 IP Spoofing:

- Performing a **SYN flood** using spoofed IPs to overload a server.
    
- Impersonating a trusted host to gain unauthorized access.

|---|---|
|**Sniffing**|Use **encryption** (HTTPS, TLS, VPN), switch networks, IDS|
|**Spoofing**|Use **packet filtering**, **firewalls**, and authentication|

## 🧾 Summary for Exam:

> IP Sniffing captures traffic to steal data by monitoring the network, while IP Spoofing involves forging IP headers to impersonate trusted sources and attack systems.

Here’s a clear, exam-friendly explanation of **active vs passive attacks**, with definitions, differences, and examples:

---

## 🔐 Active vs Passive Attacks

### 📌 1. **Passive Attack**

> A passive attack is when the attacker **monitors or intercepts** data **without altering it**.

- **Goal:** Gather information secretly
    
- **Impact:** Breach of **confidentiality**
    
- **Detection:** Hard to detect
    
- **Does Not Affect:** Integrity or availability
    

#### ✅ Examples:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Eavesdropping / Sniffing**|Capturing unencrypted data packets on a network.|
|**Traffic Analysis**|Monitoring communication patterns (who is talking to whom, how often, etc.)|
|**Shoulder Surfing**|Observing someone’s screen or keyboard secretly.|

#### 🔒 Defense:

- Encryption (SSL/TLS, VPN)
    
- Secure protocols (HTTPS)
    
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
    

---

### 📌 2. **Active Attack**

> An active attack is when the attacker **modifies, disrupts, or injects** data in the system.

- **Goal:** Cause damage, gain control, or disrupt services
    
- **Impact:** Affects **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**
    
- **Detection:** Easier to detect
    

#### ✅ Examples:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**|Intercepting and modifying communication.|
|**Denial of Service (DoS)**|Flooding a server to make it unavailable.|
|**Data Modification**|Altering a message in transit.|
|**Replay Attack**|Capturing and resending valid data packets later.|
|**Session Hijacking**|Taking over an active session between two parties.|

#### 🔒 Defense:

- Firewalls and IDS/IPS
    
- Message integrity checks (MAC, digital signatures)
    
- Strong authentication and encryption

## 🔁 Key Differences Table:

|Feature|**Passive Attack**|**Active Attack**|
|---|---|---|
|**Action**|Observes only|Modifies or disrupts|
|**Affects**|Confidentiality|Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability|
|**Detection**|Hard to detect|Easier to detect|
|**Examples**|Sniffing, Traffic Analysis|DoS, MITM, Session Hijacking|
|**Defense**|Encryption|Firewalls, IDS, Message Authentication|
