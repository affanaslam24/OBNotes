those are the generalised 2 types: we will see the ciphers in each category

sounds a lot like the example we use in symmetric key algo

hill cipher

playfair was a dugraph, where 2 alphabet pair were made, here we have poligraph

![[Pasted image 20250527154956.png]]


you choose a key whic can be 2x square or 3x square, but it needs to be square matrix.


change into vercotrs:

![[Pasted image 20250527155458.png]]


![[Pasted image 20250527155528.png]]

so we have the adj and d inverse now.

![[Pasted image 20250527155602.png]]

this


![[Pasted image 20250527155620.png]]

now we have the k inverse;


now decrypt:

Go check out [[DES, 3DES, AES]] which are part of block cipher.
Also cehck out [[types of block cipher modes]]
