Here is a **clear, exam-ready explanation of Phishing and Pharming**, including definitions, key differences, examples, and how to protect against them:

## 🕵️‍♂️ Phishing vs. Pharming

Both **phishing** and **pharming** are **social engineering attacks** aimed at **stealing sensitive information** like usernames, passwords, and financial data—but they work differently.

---

### 🐟 1. **Phishing**

#### ✅ Definition:

> **Phishing** is a cyberattack where an attacker tricks a victim into revealing sensitive information **by pretending to be a trustworthy entity**, usually via **email, SMS, or fake websites**.

#### 💡 Key Points:

- Relies on **human error** (clicking links, giving info)
    
- Often uses **emails or messages** with urgent or alarming content
    
- The **user is lured** to a fake site that looks real
    

#### 📌 Example:

- You receive an email that looks like it’s from your bank:
    
    > _“Your account is suspended. Click here to verify.”_
    
- The link leads to a fake site where you enter your password → **attacker gets your login**.
    

#### 🔒 Prevention:

- Do not click unknown or suspicious links
    
- Check sender’s email address carefully
    
- Use spam filters and browser protections
    
- Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication)

### 🌐 2. **Pharming**

#### ✅ Definition:

> **Pharming** is a cyberattack that **redirects a user from a legitimate website to a malicious one** without their knowledge, by compromising **DNS servers or the user's host file**.

#### 💡 Key Points:

- Happens **without user interaction**
    
- Exploits **DNS vulnerabilities**
    
- Victim types a correct website address but is secretly redirected to a fake site
    

#### 📌 Example:

- You type `www.mybank.com` into your browser
    
- But due to **DNS poisoning**, you’re silently redirected to a **fake clone site**
    
- You enter your login info → **attacker captures it**
    

#### 🔒 Prevention:

- Use antivirus and anti-malware software
    
- Use secure, encrypted DNS services
    
- Check for HTTPS and certificate authenticity in browsers

## 📊 Comparison Table:

|Feature|**Phishing**|**Pharming**|
|---|---|---|
|**Attack Vector**|Fake emails, messages, links|DNS spoofing, host file poisoning|
|**User Interaction**|Required (clicking, submitting info)|Not required (automatic redirection)|
|**Deception Method**|Social engineering|Technical manipulation of routing|
|**Target**|Humans|Systems (DNS/host files)|
|**Detection**|Easier (look for fake links, grammar)|Harder (everything looks legitimate)|
|**Defense**|Spam filters, awareness, 2FA|Secure DNS, antivirus, browser security|

## 🧠 Tip for Exams:

> **Phishing**: Tricking the user  
> **Pharming**: Tricking the system
