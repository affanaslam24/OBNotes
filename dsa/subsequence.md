What is subsequence?
![[Pasted image 20250426164212.png]]

it can be contiguos or non contiguous.
And needs to follow the order of elements.

meaning, 3 can be a subsequence
1 can be
2 cn be
3 1 
3 2 -- because it follows the order
3 1 2
even an empty array is a subsequence
but NOT 321 because it doesnt follows the order.

multiple calls of take and not take:
