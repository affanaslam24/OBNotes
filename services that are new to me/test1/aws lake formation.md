**AWS Lake Formation** is a service that makes it easy to set up a secure data lake in days. A data lake is a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis. A data lake enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and guide better business decisions.

Amazon S3 forms the storage layer for Lake Formation. If you already use S3, you typically begin by registering existing S3 buckets that contain your data. Lake Formation creates new buckets for the data lake and imports data into them. AWS always stores this data in your account, and only you have direct access to it.

AWS Lake Formation is integrated with AWS Glue which you can use to create a data catalog that describes available datasets and their appropriate business applications. Lake Formation lets you define policies and control data access with simple “grant and revoke permissions to data” sets at granular levels. You can assign permissions to IAM users, roles, groups, and Active Directory users using federation. You specify permissions on catalog objects (like tables and columns) rather than on buckets and objects.

Thus, the correct answer is: **Use AWS Lake Formation to consolidate data from multiple accounts into a single account.**

The option that says: **Use Amazon Data Firehose to consolidate data from multiple accounts into a single account** is incorrect. Setting up a Data Firehose in each and every account to move data into a single location is costly and impractical. A better approach is to set up cross-account sharing which is free with AWS Lake Formation.
