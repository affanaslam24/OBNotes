Absolutely! In the context of computing or cloud (especially AWS), **"throttle"** means **intentionally slowing down or limiting the rate** of a certain operation to prevent overuse or abuse of resources.

## üõë What Does "Throttle" Mean?

> **Throttling** is when a system **limits the number of requests**, data transfer, or actions **within a time period**.

It‚Äôs used to:

- Prevent **resource exhaustion**
    
- Maintain **fair usage**
    
- Ensure **system stability**
    
- Enforce **service quotas or rate limits**

## üîß Common Examples of Throttling

|**Service/Context**|**What is Throttled**|**Reason**|
|---|---|---|
|**API Gateway / REST APIs**|Number of API requests per second|To prevent abuse and control traffic|
|**AWS Lambda**|Concurrent executions or requests|Prevents overuse of compute resources|
|**DynamoDB**|Read/write throughput|Avoids exceeding provisioned or on-demand limits|
|**S3**|Request rates per prefix|Ensures backend stability during high-load access|
|**EC2 / AWS Services**|API calls (like starting/stopping instances)|Enforces API call limits to protect backend systems|

---

## üö® What Happens When Throttling Occurs?

- You get a **throttle error** like `429 Too Many Requests` or a specific AWS error like:
    
    - `ThrottlingException`
        
    - `Rate exceeded`
        
- The request may be:
    
    - **Rejected immediately**
        
    - **Delayed or retried later**
        

---

## üîÅ Best Practices to Handle Throttling

- Use **exponential backoff with jitter** (common retry pattern).
    
- Monitor usage and **increase limits** (for example, via AWS Service Quotas).
    
- Use caching or batching to **reduce request frequency**.

## üß† Simple Analogy

Imagine a **water tap** ‚Äî if you open it fully, water flows at max rate. Throttling is like **partially closing the tap** to slow the flow, preventing overflow.

If you tell me the service or use case you're seeing throttling in (e.g., Lambda, DynamoDB), I can explain it specifically.


ALSO, look for buffer and throttle difference


buffer means to store, sqs does that
throttle means to slow down.




| **Service**     | **Throttled Operations**               | **Limits/Quotas Applied**                                                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Gateway** | Number of requests per second (RPS)    | Default: 10,000 RPS per account per region (soft limit, can be increased) |
| **Lambda**      | Number of concurrent executions        | Default: 1,000 concurrent executions per account per region               |
| **DynamoDB**    | Read/write throughput or request rate  | Throttles if you exceed provisioned or on-demand capacity                 |
| **S3**          | Request rate to a single prefix        | S3 automatically scales, but aggressive access can cause slowdowns        |
| **SNS/SQS**     | Publish/send rate                      | Messages published or polled too quickly can result in throttling         |
| **CloudWatch**  | GetMetricData, PutMetricData API calls | API request rate is limited                                               |
| **EC2 API**     | Start/stop/describe instance API calls | Soft API rate limits per service action                                   |
| **AWS STS**     | AssumeRole requests per second         | Hard limit; high usage can cause `ThrottlingException`                    |
