**Amazon CloudWatch** has available Amazon EC2 Metrics for you to use for monitoring CPU utilization, Network utilization, Disk performance, and Disk Reads/Writes. In case you need to monitor the below items, you need to prepare a custom metric using a Perl or other shell script, as there are no ready to use metrics for:

1. Memory utilization
2. Disk swap utilization
3. Disk space utilization
4. Page file utilization
5. Log collection

Take note that there is a multi-platform CloudWatch agent which can be installed on both Linux and Windows-based instances. You can use a single agent to collect both system metrics and log files from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers. This agent supports both Windows Server and Linux and enables you to select the metrics to be collected, including sub-resource metrics such as per-CPU core. It is recommended that you use the new agent instead of the older monitoring scripts to collect metrics and logs.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Install the Amazon CloudWatch agent to all the EC2 instances that gather the memory and disk utilization data. View the custom metrics in the CloudWatch console.**

The option that says: **Use the default Amazon CloudWatch configuration to EC2 instances where the memory and disk utilization metrics are already available. Install the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Agent to all the EC2 instances** is incorrect because, by default, CloudWatch does not automatically provide memory and disk utilization metrics of your instances. You have to set up custom CloudWatch metrics to monitor the memory, disk swap, disk space, and page file utilization of your instances.

The option that says: **Enable the Enhanced Monitoring option in EC2 and installÂ Amazon CloudWatch agent to all the EC2 instances to be able to view the memory and disk utilization in the CloudWatch dashboard** is incorrect because Enhanced Monitoring is only a feature of Amazon RDS. By default, Enhanced Monitoring metrics are stored for 30 days in the CloudWatch Logs.

The option that says: **Use Amazon Inspector and install the Inspector agent to all EC2 instances** is incorrect because Amazon Inspector is primarily an automated security assessment service that helps you test the network accessibility of your Amazon EC2 instances and the security state of your applications running on the instances. It does not provide a custom metric to track the memory and disk utilization of each and every EC2 instance in your VPC.



By **default**, **Amazon CloudWatch does **_not_** collect** the following metrics for your EC2 instances:

- **Memory utilization**
    
- **Disk space usage** (e.g., % used on EBS volumes or root volume)
    
- **Swap usage**
    
- **Processes running**, etc.
