An e-commerce company utilizes a regional Amazon API Gateway to host its public REST APIs. The API Gateway endpoint is accessed through a custom domain name set up with an Amazon Route 53 alias record. To support continuous improvement, the company intends to launch a new version of its APIs with enhanced features and performance optimizations.




**Amazon API Gateway** is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. It is a front door for your APIs, enabling you to design and implement scalable, highly available, and secure APIs. With Amazon API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs that any HTTP client, such as web browsers and mobile devices, can consume.

Implementing a canary release deployment strategy for the API Gateway is a great way to ensure your APIs remain stable and reliable. This strategy involves releasing a new version of your API to a small subset of users, allowing you to test the latest version in a controlled environment.

If the new version performs well, you can gradually roll out the update to the rest of your users. This approach lets you catch any issues before they affect your entire user base, minimizing the impact on your customers. By using Amazon API Gateway, you can quickly implement a canary release deployment strategy, ensuring that your APIs are always up-to-date and performing at their best.

Hence, the correct answer is:Â **Implement a canary release deployment strategy for the API Gateway. Deploy the latest version of the APIs to a canary stage and direct a portion of the user traffic to this stage. Verify the new APIs. Gradually increase the traffic percentage, monitor for any issues, and, if successful, promote the canary stage to production.**
