**Create a zero spend budget template in AWS Budgets** is incorrect because the zero spend budget template merely gives you an alert when your spending exceeds AWS Free Tier limits. However, it only provides basic alerts and lacks advanced monitoring or anomaly detection.

The option that says: **Use AWS Cost Explorer and enable multi-year data at monthly granularity** is incorrect. This solution would help in analyzing spending over time, but it primarily won’t actively alert you to anomalies or unusual spending patterns.

The option that says: **Enable Amazon CloudWatch to monitor costs and detect unusual spending** is incorrect. Although the Amazon Cloudwatch can be configured to alert based on the `EstimateCharges` metric, it has no capability of determining whether breaches of a set limit are due to unusual spending or normal/expected increases.
