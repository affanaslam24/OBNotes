it is best to simply allocate the corresponding number of ACUs and let Aurora Serverless handle the scaling up/down. The unit of measure for Aurora Serverless v2 is theÂ Aurora capacity unit (ACU). Each ACU includes about 2 gibibytes (GiB) of memory, along with the necessary CPU and networking. By setting a range with a minimum of 1 ACU and a maximum of 8 ACUs, you can ensure that the database scales efficiently to meet demand, from minimal to peak usage.
