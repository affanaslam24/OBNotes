Many companies that distribute content over the internet want to restrict access to documents, business data, media streams, or content that is intended for selected users, for example, users who have paid a fee. To securely serve this private content by using CloudFront, you can do the following:

– Require that your users access your private content by using special CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies.

– Require that your users access your content by using CloudFront URLs, not URLs that access content directly on the origin server (for example, Amazon S3 or a private HTTP server). Requiring CloudFront URLs isn’t necessary, but we recommend it to prevent users from bypassing the restrictions that you specify in signed URLs or signed cookies.

CloudFront signed URLs and signed cookies provide the same basic functionality: they allow you to control who can access your content.

If you want to serve private content through CloudFront and you’re trying to decide whether to use signed URLs or signed cookies, consider the following:

Use **signed URLs** for the following cases:

– You want to use an RTMP distribution. Signed cookies aren’t supported for RTMP distributions.

– You want to restrict access to individual files, for example, an installation download for your application.

– Your users are using a client (for example, a custom HTTP client) that doesn’t support cookies.

Use **signed cookies** for the following cases:

– You want to provide access to multiple restricted files, for example, all of the files for a video in HLS format or all of the files in the subscribers’ area of a website.

– You don’t want to change your current URLs.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Use Signed Cookies to control who can access the private files in your CloudFront distribution by modifying your application to determine whether a user should have access to your content. For members, send the required `Set-Cookie` headers to the viewer which will unlock the content only to them.**

The option that says: **Configure your CloudFront distribution to use Match Viewer as its Origin Protocol Policy which will automatically match the user request. This will allow access to the private content if the request is a paying member and deny it if it is not a member** is incorrect because a Match Viewer is an Origin Protocol Policy that configures CloudFront to communicate with your origin using HTTP or HTTPS, depending on the protocol of the viewer request. CloudFront caches the object only once even if viewers make requests using both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

The option that says: **Create a Signed URL with a custom policy which only allows the members to see the private files**




**Signed cookies** are used to **control access** to your content in web applications — especially for **securely serving private content** via **CDNs** like **Amazon CloudFront**.

## 🍪 What Are Signed Cookies?

> A **signed cookie** is a type of HTTP cookie that contains **a digital signature**, proving that the user is authorized to access certain restricted resources.

---

## 🛡️ Why Use Signed Cookies?

They allow you to:

- Restrict access to private content
    
- Define who can access what and **for how long**
    
- Avoid exposing direct credentials or tokens
    
- Work better than signed URLs when **multiple resources** need to be accessed
    

---

## 📦 Common Use Case: **Amazon CloudFront + S3**

You host private content (videos, documents, etc.) in **S3** and serve it using **CloudFront**. You want only **authorized users** to access it.

You can use either:

- **Signed URLs** – good for one file at a time
    
- ✅ **Signed Cookies** – better when a user needs access to **multiple files** (e.g., a whole video folder)
    

---

## 🔑 How Signed Cookies Work

1. You generate a **signed cookie** with:
    
    - **Policy** (IP restriction, expiration, resource path)
        
    - **Signature** (using a **private key**)
        
    - **Key-Pair ID** (refers to the matching **public key** in CloudFront)
        
2. You **set the cookie** in the user’s browser.
    
3. CloudFront **validates the cookie** when the user requests content.
    
4. If valid, the content is delivered. If not, it returns a `403 Forbidden`.

## 🔐 Cookie Components (CloudFront)

CloudFront signed cookies typically consist of:

- `CloudFront-Policy`
    
- `CloudFront-Signature`
    
- `CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id`
    

---

## 📋 Example Scenario

Say you run an online course platform:

- Premium users can access all lecture videos for 7 days.
    
- You generate **signed cookies** valid for 7 days.
    
- The cookie allows access to `https://cdn.example.com/videos/*`.

## 🔄 Signed Cookies vs Signed URLs

|Feature|**Signed URL**|**Signed Cookie**|
|---|---|---|
|Use case|Single file|Multiple files|
|Ease of use|Simple, per-resource|Better for sessions|
|Client-side storage|URL param|Browser cookie|
|Ideal for|One-time file downloads|Streaming or batch access|

---

## 🧰 Tools

- AWS SDKs or `aws-cloudfront-sign` tools
    
- Private key stored securely
    
- Public key uploaded to CloudFront
    

---

If you’re building a project that needs **authenticated file access** or **premium content protection**, signed cookies are a secure and scalable option.
