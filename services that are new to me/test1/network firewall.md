**Use AWS Network Firewall to filter web vulnerabilities and brute force attacks using stateful rule groups across all Application Load Balancers on all AWS accounts. Refactor the web application to be less susceptible to SQL injection attacks based on the security assessment**is incorrect because AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that is primarily used to deploy essential network protections for all of your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and not particularly to your Application Load Balancers. Take note that the AWS Network Firewall is account-specific by default and needs to be integrated with the AWS Firewall Manager to easily share the firewall across your other AWS accounts. In addition, refactoring the web application will require an immense amount of time.
