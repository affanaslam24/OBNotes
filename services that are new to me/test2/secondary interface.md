If one of your instances serving a particular function fails, its network interface can be attached to a replacement or hot standby instance pre-configured for the same role in order to rapidly recover the service. For example, you can use a network interface as your primary or secondary network interface to a critical service such as a database instance or a NAT instance. If the instance fails, you (or more likely, the code running on your behalf) can attach the network interface to a hot standby instance.

![](https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/reattach-secondary-network-interface.jpg)Because the interface maintains its private IP addresses, Elastic IP addresses, and MAC address, network traffic begins flowing to the standby instance as soon as you attach the network interface to the replacement instance. Users experience a brief loss of connectivity between the time the instance fails and the time that the network interface is attached to the standby instance, but no changes to the route table or your DNS server are required.

Hence, the correct answer is **Create a secondary elastic network interface and point its private IPv4 address to the application’s domain name. Attach the new network interface to the primary instance. If the instance goes down, move the secondary network interface to another instance.**

The option that says: **Attach an elastic IP address to the instance’s primary network interface and point its IP address to the application’s domain name. Automatically move the EIP to a secondary instance if the primary instance becomes unavailable using the AWS Transit Gateway** is incorrect. Elastic IPs are not needed in the solution since the application is private. Furthermore, an AWS Transit Gateway is primarily used to connect your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks through a central hub. This particular networking service cannot be used to automatically move an Elastic IP address to another EC2 instance.
