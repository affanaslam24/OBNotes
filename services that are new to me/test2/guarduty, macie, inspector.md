inspector is for ip address leakage, or resource specific thign.

macie is remeber s3,a dn remmeber whats being stored inside and constantly inspect whats inside.

guarduty is for resource compromise, account compromise, malicious ip attacks.


- **Use GuardDuty** when you want **real-time threat detection** across your AWS accounts and workloads.
    
- **Use Macie** if you're dealing with **sensitive data (PII)** in S3 and need to discover/classify/protect it.
    
- **Use Inspector** to perform **vulnerability assessments** on your EC2, ECR, and Lambda container workloads.
