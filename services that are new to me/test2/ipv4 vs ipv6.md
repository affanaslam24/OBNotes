You cannot disable IPv4 support for your VPC and subnets since this is the default IP addressing system for Amazon VPC and Amazon EC2.


**Set up a new IPv6-only subnet with a large CIDR range. Associate the new subnet with the VPC then launch the instance** is incorrect. While it is possible to create an IPv6-only subnet, this feature is only supported for nitro EC2 instance type. Additionally, the scenario does not specify the instance type. Therefore, this option is not applicable for non-Nitro instances, despite the VPC being IPv6-enabled.

The option that says: **Ensure that the VPC has IPv6 CIDRs only. Remove any IPv4 CIDRs associated with the VPC** is incorrect because you can't have a VPC with IPv6 CIDRs only. The default IP addressing system in VPC is IPv4. You can only change your VPC to dual-stack mode where your resources can communicate over IPv4, or IPv6, or both, but not exclusively with IPv6 only.

The option that says: **Disable the IPv4 support in the VPC and use the available IPv6 addresses** is incorrect because you cannot disable the IPv4 support for your VPC and subnets since this is the default IP addressing system.
