Here is a list of important information about EBS Volumes:

- When you create an EBS volume in an Availability Zone, it is automatically replicated within that zone to prevent data loss due to a failure of any single hardware component.

- After you create a volume, you can attach it to any EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone

-Â Amazon EBS Multi-Attach enables you to attach a single Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volume to multiple Nitro-based instances that are in the same Availability Zone. However, other EBS types are not supported.

- An EBS volume is off-instance storage that can persist independently from the life of an instance. You can specify not to terminate the EBS volume when you terminate the EC2 instance during instance creation.

- EBS volumes support live configuration changes while in production which means that you can modify the volume type, volume size, and IOPS capacity without service interruptions.

- Amazon EBS encryption uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard algorithms (AES-256)

- EBS Volumes offer 99.999% SLA.
