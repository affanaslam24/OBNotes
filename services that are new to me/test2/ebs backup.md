What is the fastest and most cost-effective solution to automatically back up all of the EBS Volumes?


**Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)** automates the creation, retention, and deletion of Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshots. It simplifies EBS volume management by allowing you to define policies that govern the lifecycle of these snapshots, ensuring regular backups are created and obsolete snapshots are automatically removed.
