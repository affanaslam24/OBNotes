Great question! Let’s break down the **difference between NLB (Network Load Balancer) and ALB (Application Load Balancer)** with real-world **use cases**, so you can clearly understand **when to use which one**.

---

### 🔄 **NLB vs ALB – Quick Comparison**

|Feature|**NLB (Network Load Balancer)**|**ALB (Application Load Balancer)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Protocol Support**|Layer 4 – TCP, UDP, TLS|Layer 7 – HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket|
|**Performance**|Extremely fast and handles millions of requests/sec|Very scalable, optimized for HTTP/S|
|**Target Types**|IP, Instance, Lambda|IP, Instance, Lambda|
|**Routing Logic**|Basic – based on IP & port|Advanced – host/path/header/method etc.|
|**TLS Termination**|Supported|Supported|
|**WebSocket Support**|✅ Yes|✅ Yes|
|**Use Case**|High-performance, low-latency applications|Web apps with advanced routing needs|

### 🎯 **Use Cases**

#### ✅ **When to use NLB (Network Load Balancer)**

> **Use case**: You have an ultra-low latency application or need to handle massive traffic spikes, or need to route TCP/UDP traffic.

- Real-time gaming server using **UDP**
    
- High-speed **financial trading system**
    
- **IoT** systems that send frequent, small TCP packets
    
- Exposing **non-HTTP services** like SMTP, RDP, SSH over the internet
    
- TLS pass-through (keep the TLS session all the way to backend)
    

#### ✅ **When to use ALB (Application Load Balancer)**

> **Use case**: You're building a modern web app with HTTP/HTTPS and want smart routing features.

- Host-based routing: `api.example.com` vs `images.example.com`
    
- Path-based routing: `/api/*` goes to one service, `/images/*` to another
    
- REST APIs or **GraphQL** backend
    
- **WebSocket**-based apps (chat, gaming) with more routing control
    
- Authentication & authorization directly from the ALB (OIDC, Cognito)
    

---

### ⚠️ Example Scenario

**You’re building a web app with a frontend, backend, and admin portal:**

- 🧠 Use **ALB** to:
    
    - Route `/admin/*` to admin server
        
    - Route `/api/*` to backend
        
    - Terminate HTTPS at the ALB
        
    - Add Cognito authentication at the load balancer level
        

**You're running a TCP-based analytics engine on EC2:**

- ⚡ Use **NLB** to:
    
    - Forward raw TCP traffic to the backend without inspection
        
    - Achieve ultra-low latency for real-time data processing

### ❓**Question:**

A company is hosting a containerized application on Amazon ECS. The application has a public-facing web front end that requires HTTP routing based on the URL path. Additionally, the application has an internal TCP-based microservice that must be exposed to specific partner systems for real-time communication with low latency.

What combination of load balancers should a Solutions Architect recommend to meet these requirements?

---

### ✅ **Answer Options:**

A. Use an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for both the web front end and the internal microservice.  
B. Use a **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** for both the web front end and the internal microservice.  
C. Use an **ALB for the web front end** and an **NLB for the internal microservice**.  
D. Use a **Classic Load Balancer** for the web front end and an NLB for the internal microservice.

---

### ✅ **Correct Answer: C**

> **Use an ALB for the web front end and an NLB for the internal microservice.**
