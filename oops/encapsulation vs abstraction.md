Great comparison! **Encapsulation** and **Abstraction** are closely related in Object-Oriented Programming but serve **different purposes**:

## üîê **Encapsulation** vs üé≠ **Abstraction**

|Feature|**Encapsulation**|**Abstraction**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Binding data and methods into one unit|Hiding internal details, showing only functionality|
|**Purpose**|Protect data from outside interference|Simplify complexity by hiding details|
|**Focus**|**How** you protect the data|**What** is exposed to the user|
|**Access**|Achieved via access modifiers (`private`, etc.)|Achieved using abstract classes or interfaces|
|**Hides**|The **data** (by restricting access)|The **implementation** (only shows behavior)|
|**Example**|Private fields + public getters/setters|Interface with methods like `drive()`, hiding how it's done|
|**Real World**|A pill capsule hiding the medicine inside|A TV remote hiding the internal circuits and logic|
|**Main Use**|To control and protect data|To provide a simplified interface|

### ‚úÖ **Example to Illustrate Both Together**

```java
abstract class Vehicle {        // Abstraction
    abstract void start();      // Only "what" to do, not "how"
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    private String engineStatus;     // Encapsulation: hiding data

    public void setEngineStatus(String status) {
        this.engineStatus = status;  // Encapsulation: controlled access
    }

    public String getEngineStatus() {
        return this.engineStatus;
    }

    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car engine started");  // Implementation of abstract method
    }
}
```

## üîë Summary:

- **Encapsulation** is about **data hiding**.
    
- **Abstraction** is about **detail hiding**.
    
- You often **use both together**: encapsulate the fields of a class and abstract the behavior using interfaces or abstract classes.
    

Would you like a quick quiz or analogy-based trick to remember the difference?
