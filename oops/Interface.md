interface methods are by default public and abstreact


Certainly! Here's an in-depth breakdown of **interfaces** in Java, focusing on their intricacies and how they compare to abstract classes:

---

## üîç **What is an Interface?**

An **interface** in Java defines a **contract** for what a class should do, but not how it does it. It contains **only method declarations** (abstract methods), and a class that implements an interface must provide implementations for those methods.

```java
interface Animal {
    void makeSound();  // method declaration (abstract by default)
}
```

## üß± **Key Characteristics of Interfaces**:

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Cannot have constructors**|You cannot instantiate an interface directly using `new`.|
|**Cannot have instance fields**|All fields in an interface are implicitly `public static final` (constants).|
|**Can have abstract methods**|All methods are implicitly abstract until Java 8, but must be implemented by the implementing class.|
|**Can have default methods** (Java 8+)|Methods with a default implementation, but still allow overriding.|
|**Can have static methods** (Java 8+)|Methods with a body that belong to the interface itself, not instances.|
|**Supports multiple inheritance**|A class can implement multiple interfaces, unlike abstract classes.|
|**Can implement multiple interfaces**|A class can implement many interfaces at the same time.|
|**Cannot have instance variables**|Only constants (i.e., `public static final` fields) are allowed.|
|**Cannot be instantiated**|Interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.|
|**Can extend other interfaces**|An interface can extend other interfaces using `extends`.|

## üß† **Rules to Remember for Interfaces**:

### ‚úÖ **1. All Methods in an Interface Are Public and Abstract by Default (Until Java 8)**

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();  // Implicitly public abstract
}
```

### ‚úÖ **2. Can Have Default Methods (Java 8+)**

You can provide a **default implementation** of a method within an interface. This allows classes that implement the interface to use the default implementation unless they override it.

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();  // abstract method

    default void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating food...");  // default method
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **3. Can Have Static Methods (Java 8+)**

Interfaces can also contain **static methods**, which belong to the interface itself and cannot be overridden by implementing classes.

```java
interface Animal {
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method in the interface");
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **4. A Class Can Implement Multiple Interfaces**

A class can **implement multiple interfaces**. This is one of the key advantages of interfaces in Java, enabling **multiple inheritance** of behavior.

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

interface Swimmable {
    void swim();
}

class Duck implements Flyable, Swimmable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Duck is flying");
    }

    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("Duck is swimming");
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ **5. Cannot Have Instance Fields**

An interface can only have **constant fields**, i.e., `public static final` variables, not instance variables.

```java
interface Animal {
    public static final int MAX_AGE = 100;  // constant field
}
```

## üîÑ **Interface vs Abstract Class**:

|Feature|Interface|Abstract Class|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Define a contract (behavior)|Define a common structure (with optional implementation)|
|**Methods**|Can have only abstract methods (before Java 8) and default/static methods (from Java 8)|Can have both abstract and concrete (implemented) methods|
|**Fields**|Can only have public static final fields (constants)|Can have instance variables, including private ones|
|**Multiple Inheritance**|A class can implement multiple interfaces|A class can extend only one abstract class|
|**Constructor**|Cannot have constructors|Can have constructors|
|**Default Methods**|Yes (from Java 8 onwards)|No|
|**Static Methods**|Yes (from Java 8 onwards)|Yes (can be static, but belongs to the class)|

## üß™ **Example in Real Use:**

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void start();  // Abstract method
    default void stop() {  // Default method
        System.out.println("Vehicle stops");
    }
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts");
    }

    // Optionally override stop() if necessary
}
```

## ‚ùó **Gotchas & Interview Nuggets for Interfaces**:

1. **Interfaces support multiple inheritance** while **abstract classes** do not.
    
2. **Interfaces are implemented**, **abstract classes are extended**.
    
3. **Interfaces cannot have concrete fields** (except constants). All fields in interfaces are implicitly `public static final`.
    
4. **An abstract class can have constructors**, while an interface cannot.
    
5. **Default methods in interfaces** allow adding functionality to interfaces without breaking existing code.

|---|---|---|
|Can have abstract methods?|‚úÖ Yes|‚úÖ Yes|
