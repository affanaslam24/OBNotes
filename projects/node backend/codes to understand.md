router.post('/add-doctor', upload.single('image'), addDoctor);
Great question! Let's break down this line:

```js
router.post('/add-doctor', upload.single('image'), addDoctor);
```

This line defines a **POST API route** in Express for adding a doctor — here's what each part does:

### 🔍 Breakdown:

|Part|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`router.post('/add-doctor', ...)`|Define a **POST** route at `/add-doctor`. It listens for POST requests like from a form submission.|
|`upload.single('image')`|Middleware from **Multer** that handles **file upload**. It expects a single file with the field name `image` (like from a form).|
|`addDoctor`|This is your **controller function** (usually defined in `adminController.js`) that gets called after the file is uploaded. It handles saving the doctor's data and probably the file URL to the database.|

### ✅ Real-world example flow:

1. A user submits a form with doctor details + an image.
    
2. The request hits `/add-doctor`.
    
3. `upload.single('image')` extracts the image from the form and temporarily stores it.
    
4. The file info (like path, filename) is added to `req.file`.
    
5. `addDoctor(req, res)` runs — it can now:
    
    - Access `req.body` for text fields (like name, specialty)
        
    - Access `req.file` for the image
        
    - Upload the image to Cloudinary (or elsewhere)
        
    - Save the doctor data + image URL in the DB
        
    - Send a response back to the client

### 🧠 Summary:

This line wires together:

- 📥 HTTP POST route
    
- 🧰 File-upload handling
    
- 📦 Business logic (addDoctor)
    

It’s the heart of backend data handling in many apps.
