controller
config
middleware
model
route


Absolutely! These folders are commonly used in a well-structured **Express.js (Node.js)** project that follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern (or a variation of it). Here's what each one typically contains:

---

### 📁 `controller/` — **Business Logic**

- **Purpose**: Handles the logic for processing incoming requests.
    
- **Example**: `userController.js` might contain functions like `registerUser`, `loginUser`, etc.
    
- **Used in**: Route files — routes call controller functions to perform tasks.
    

---

### 📁 `model/` — **Database Schemas**

- **Purpose**: Defines the data structure and schema for MongoDB (usually via **Mongoose**).
    
- **Example**: `User.js` defines a Mongoose model with fields like `name`, `email`, `password`, etc.
    

---

### 📁 `route/` — **API Endpoints**

- **Purpose**: Defines application routes and maps them to controller functions.
    
- **Example**: `userRoutes.js` might map `POST /register` to `userController.registerUser`.
    

```js
router.post('/register', registerUser);
```

---

### 📁 `middleware/` — **Middle-layer Logic**

- **Purpose**: Reusable logic that runs _before_ hitting the controller.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Auth check (e.g., `authMiddleware.js`)
        
    - Error handler
        
    - File upload handler (like `multer.js`)
        

---

### 📁 `config/` — **Configuration Files**

- **Purpose**: Contains setup files, often for external services.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - `db.js` to connect to MongoDB
        
    - `cloudinaryConfig.js`
        
    - `dotenv` and other third-party configs

### 🧠 High-Level Flow:

1. **Client hits an endpoint** defined in `route/`
    
2. The route calls the **controller function**
    
3. The controller might use a **model** to access the database
    
4. Middleware may run **before** controller functions
    
5. Configs support things like **DB connections** and **external services**

Would you like me to generate a minimal project folder with files and sample code to show how they work together?
