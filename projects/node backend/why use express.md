## Why are we using Express?

Express is used to:

1. **Create a web server** in Node.js
    
2. **Handle HTTP requests/responses** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
    
3. **Define routes** like `/login`, `/addDoctor`, etc.
    
4. **Use middleware** for tasks like file uploads (like `multer.js`), logging, authentication, etc.
