#### `const connectDb = async () => { ... }`

- Defines an **asynchronous function** `connectDb` that will handle the DB connection logic.
    
- We use `async` because `mongoose.connect()` returns a **Promise**.



mongoose.connection.on.... sets up a **listener** that logs a message only when the `"connected"` event is emitted by Mongoose.



Absolutely ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down this line completely:

---

### üîç **Line in question:**

```js
await mongoose.connect(`${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/prescripto`);
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-step breakdown:

---

### üî∏ `await`

- This pauses the function **until the Promise resolves**.
    
- Since `mongoose.connect(...)` returns a **Promise**, using `await` ensures the rest of your code won‚Äôt execute until MongoDB is connected.
    
- It can only be used inside an **async function** ‚Äî which you‚Äôve done correctly with `const connectDb = async () => { ... }`.
    

---

### üî∏ `mongoose.connect(...)`

- This is a function provided by Mongoose to **initiate a connection to MongoDB**.
    
- Under the hood, it creates a connection using MongoDB‚Äôs native driver.
    
- You **must** connect before interacting with the database (inserting, reading, etc.).
    

---

### üî∏ `` `${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/prescripto` ``

This is a **template literal**, which lets you embed variables inside strings using backticks and `${...}`.

#### üìå `process.env.MONGODB_URI`

- This accesses an **environment variable** named `MONGODB_URI`.
    
- `process.env` is Node.js‚Äôs way of reading values defined in your `.env` file or system environment.
    

#### üîê Why use environment variables?

- You should **never hardcode sensitive info** (like MongoDB URIs with usernames and passwords) in code.
    
- Instead, store them in a `.env` file like:
    
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net
    ```
    

#### üß± `/prescripto`

- This is the **specific database name** in your MongoDB cluster.
    
- MongoDB will automatically create this database when you first write data to it if it doesn't already exist.
    

#### ‚úÖ Full example after evaluation:

Let‚Äôs say `.env` has:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://admin:admin123@cluster0.mongodb.net
```

Then:

```js
`${process.env.MONGODB_URI}/prescripto`
```

becomes:

```js
"mongodb+srv://admin:admin123@cluster0.mongodb.net/prescripto"
```

That‚Äôs the final URI Mongoose uses to connect.

---

## üß† Summary:

This line tells Mongoose:

> ‚ÄúConnect to the MongoDB cluster using credentials and host stored in `MONGODB_URI`, and work specifically with the `prescripto` database. Don‚Äôt move forward in the code until you‚Äôre fully connected.‚Äù

#### `export default connectDb`

- This exports the function so it can be imported and used in other files (like `index.js` or `server.js`).
