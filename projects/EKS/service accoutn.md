In Kubernetes, a **ServiceAccount** is a special kind of account used **by applications (pods) to interact with the Kubernetes API**.

---

### üß† **Why ServiceAccounts Exist**

When a **pod** needs to do things like:

- Read secrets
    
- List or watch other pods
    
- Access a ConfigMap
    
- Communicate with the Kubernetes API
    

‚Ä¶it needs **credentials**. A **ServiceAccount provides those credentials**.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **How it Works**

- Every pod is **automatically assigned** a default ServiceAccount from its namespace unless you specify another one.
    
- The credentials (a token) are **mounted into the pod** at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.
    
- This token allows the app inside the pod to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server.
    

---

### üßæ Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-app-sa
```

Then you can tell a pod to use it:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app-pod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: my-app-sa
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: my-image
```

---

### üîí Permissions

By itself, a ServiceAccount doesn't have permissions. You need to **grant permissions** using **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: my-app-binding
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: my-app-sa
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: my-app-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

---

### üß© Use Cases

- Letting your app read secrets from the API
    
- Allowing a pod to update ConfigMaps or interact with other resources
    
- Needed for controllers or jobs that automate Kubernetes resources
    

---

### üîê Security Tip

Don‚Äôt let pods use the default ServiceAccount if they don‚Äôt need API access‚Äî**create a minimal ServiceAccount and restrict permissions tightly**.

# IAM roles and service account connection


Ahhh perfect follow-up! This is where **Kubernetes**, **IAM Roles**, and **OIDC** (OpenID Connect) all link together like pieces of a security puzzle üß©. Let's walk through it step-by-step, no confusion, no fluff.

---

## üß† First, what are we trying to solve?

You have a pod running in **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**. That pod wants to talk to an AWS service like **S3**, **DynamoDB**, etc.

But here's the problem:  
‚õî Pods don't have IAM roles directly like EC2 instances do.

So‚Ä¶ how do you securely allow a pod to get AWS permissions?

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: **IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)**

This is where **OIDC**, **IAM roles**, and **ServiceAccounts** work together.

---

## üí° How it works ‚Äî in simple terms

### 1. **OIDC provider is set up in your AWS account**

- OIDC is an identity layer built on top of OAuth2.
    
- AWS says: ‚ÄúI trust this Kubernetes cluster to tell me who a pod is.‚Äù
    
- EKS exposes an OIDC endpoint like:  
    `https://oidc.eks.<region>.amazonaws.com/id/<cluster-id>`
    

### 2. **Create a ServiceAccount in EKS**

This will be the "badge" your pod uses.

### 3. **Create an IAM Role**

With a trust policy like:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.<region>.amazonaws.com/id/<cluster-id>"
  },
  "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "oidc.eks.<region>.amazonaws.com/id/<cluster-id>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<serviceaccount-name>"
    }
  }
}
```

This IAM role trusts a **specific ServiceAccount** in your cluster via OIDC.

### 4. **Attach policies** to this IAM role (S3, DynamoDB, etc.)

### 5. **Link the IAM role to the ServiceAccount**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: s3-access-sa
  annotations:
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/s3-access-role
```

### 6. **Use that ServiceAccount in your pod**

Now, any pod using `s3-access-sa` will get the credentials to access AWS services!

---

## üîê Security Magic

- The pod receives a JWT token from Kubernetes.
    
- When it wants to access AWS, it uses **`AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`**.
    
- AWS validates the JWT using the OIDC provider, confirms it matches the right ServiceAccount, and hands back **temporary AWS credentials**.
    

---

## üéØ Summary

|Component|Role in the Flow|
|---|---|
|**OIDC provider**|Connects EKS ‚Üí IAM trust|
|**ServiceAccount**|Identity of the pod inside Kubernetes|
|**IAM Role**|AWS permissions for the pod|
|**Trust Policy**|Ensures only a specific ServiceAccount can use the role|
|**IRSA**|Whole system that links them all securely|
