A weather forecast agency collects key weather metrics across multiple cities in the US and sends this data in the form of key-value pairs to AWS Cloud at a one-minute frequency.

As a solutions architect, which of the following AWS services would you use to build a solution for processing and then reliably storing this data with high availability? (Select two)



**AWS Lambda**

With AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time that you consumeâ€”thereâ€™s no charge when your code isnâ€™t running. You can run code for virtually any type of application or backend serviceâ€”all with zero administration.

**Amazon DynamoDB**

Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-master, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database and it's best suited to store data in key-value pairs.

AWS Lambda can be combined with DynamoDB to process and capture the key-value data from the IoT sources described in the use-case. So both these options are correct.

Incorrect options:

**Amazon Redshift** - Amazon Redshift is a fully-managed petabyte-scale cloud-based data warehouse product designed for large scale data set storage and analysis. You cannot use Redshift to capture data in key-value pairs from the IoT sources, so this option is not correct.

**Amazon ElastiCache** - Amazon ElastiCache allows you to seamlessly set up, run, and scale popular open-Source compatible in-memory data stores in the cloud. Build data-intensive apps or boost the performance of your existing databases by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores. Amazon ElastiCache is a popular choice for real-time use cases like Caching, Session Stores, Gaming, Geospatial Services, Real-Time Analytics, and Queuing. Elasticache is used as a caching layer in front of relational databases. It is not a good fit to store data in key-value pairs from the IoT sources, so this option is not correct.

**Amazon RDS** - Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. Relational databases are not a good fit to store data in key-value pairs, so this option is not correct.

Great question â€” Redshift and DynamoDB are often used **together** when you need **fast operational storage** (DynamoDB) and **analytical processing** (Redshift). Here's how they work together:

---

### ðŸ”¹ Use Case:

- You store real-time or high-throughput data in **DynamoDB** (e.g., user activity, IoT data).
    
- You need to **analyze** that data using **complex SQL**, **joins**, **aggregations**, or integrate with other datasets â€” that's where **Redshift** comes in.
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ **There are two main ways Redshift integrates with DynamoDB:**

#### 1. **Redshift COPY command to import from DynamoDB**

- Redshift has a built-in **`COPY` command** that supports loading data **directly from a DynamoDB table** into Redshift.
    
- You can **run periodic batch loads** for analysis.
    

```sql
COPY my_redshift_table
FROM 'dynamodb://my_dynamodb_table'
IAM_ROLE 'arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/MyRedshiftRole'
REGION 'us-east-1';
```

âœ… Use this for:

- Ingesting historical data for analytics.
    
- Joining DynamoDB data with other tables in Redshift.
    

---

#### 2. **Using AWS Glue (ETL) between DynamoDB and Redshift**

- AWS Glue can **extract data from DynamoDB**, **transform it**, and **load it into Redshift**.
    
- This gives you more flexibility to **clean, enrich, or format** data before analysis.
    

âœ… Use this when:

- You want to process large datasets.
    
- You need transformations before loading into Redshift.
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example Architecture:

```
DynamoDB (real-time data) 
       â†“
  [Glue or COPY]
       â†“
Amazon Redshift (analytics, dashboards, SQL)
```

---

### ðŸ§  TL;DR:

- **DynamoDB** = fast operational NoSQL DB.
    
- **Redshift** = powerful SQL analytics engine.
    
- Use **COPY** or **AWS Glue** to bring data from DynamoDB into Redshift for analytics.
