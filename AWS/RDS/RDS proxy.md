"Connect the database and the application layer using RDS Proxy‚Äù is incorrect. RDS proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability. It does not however specifically improve read performance like a caching layer would.

Its basically used for connecting to the RDS.

Amazon RDS Proxy is a fully managed, highly available database proxy for Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) that makes applications more scalable, more resilient to database failures, and more secure. Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability.

Amazon RDS Proxy can be enabled for most applications with no code changes so this solution requires the least amount of code changes.

### üß© What is **RDS Proxy** in AWS?

**Amazon RDS Proxy** is a **fully managed, highly available database proxy** for **Amazon RDS** and **Aurora**. It **sits between your application and the database** to improve performance, scalability, and security.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Why Use RDS Proxy?
|Benefit|Description|
|---|---|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Connection pooling**|Reduces the overhead of opening/closing DB connections (very useful for serverless apps like Lambda).|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Improves scalability**|Helps handle thousands of concurrent connections without exhausting database resources.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Better availability**|Automatically fails over to standby DB in case of failover, minimizing downtime.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**IAM authentication**|Supports **IAM-based authentication**, reducing the need to manage DB credentials directly.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Secure**|Runs within your VPC and uses AWS Secrets Manager for credentials.|



App ‚Üí RDS Proxy ‚Üí RDS/Aurora DB


Instead of your app hitting the database directly, it connects to the **RDS Proxy**, which handles:

- Managing and reusing DB connections
    
- Queueing and retrying failed attempts
    
- Managing failover seamlessly

### üöÄ Example Use Case:

You have an AWS Lambda function that hits an RDS MySQL database. Without a proxy:

- Each Lambda execution creates a **new connection**
    
- RDS has limited connections ‚Äî could cause **connection exhaustion**
    

With **RDS Proxy**:

- Connections are **pooled and reused**
    
- You handle **more concurrent users** efficiently
