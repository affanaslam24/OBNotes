what i do understand is, the logs are turned into a big bunch of log streams coming from same cource (idk what this source is? is this one ec2 or a same specific thing cokkming foorm the ec2). Then a group is formed from these log streams, and then a metric filter is applied on it which gives us the metrics required and can be further used to create alarm.
