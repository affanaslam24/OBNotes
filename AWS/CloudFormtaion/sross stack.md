- you cant use !ref here
- export name must be unique in one region of the account
- importValue basically imports the value from the exported name




![[Pasted image 20250410191020.png]]- exports are regional. Meaning, they are in that region onlly, and they must be unique in thAT region. Each region has a set of experts. and every account having mukkltipel region will have muiltiple exports to thweir region that are isolated to that region onlly.
- therefore, cross region or cross acount stacks are not supported, because conflict of exports



- remeber that cross stack uses resources to be used outside of a stack to other stzcks.
- on the other hand, nested stack uses template, which are not the same stacks.
- each template creates a different stack. And in nested stack, there is nested reutilisation, not the resrouce reutilisation.
