- a stack shares its lifecycle with the resources inside its created
- these resources can be accessed by other stacks easily.

these makes me question:
Q. can i use the resources created by stack apart from other stakcs? like make an ec2 insid ea vpc? yes.
**Q. can i make changes to resources made by a stack? idk**
