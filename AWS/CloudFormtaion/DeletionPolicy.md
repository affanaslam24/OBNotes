- anything that you DELETE in the template and then reapply in your stack
- there is a posibility that you change somemthing inside your template and push that template to crete a stack, and seeing that, the existing resource might get deleted and a new resource is launched. but this is not covered under deletion policy.
- think of EC2 servers in this context.
