An application on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) performs data processing in two parts. The second part takes much longer to complete. How can an Architect decouple the data processing from the backend application component?



keyword is decouple, and that its not a stream from more than one produccer


Processing each part using a separate ECS task may not be essential but means you can separate the processing of the data. An Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is used for decoupling applications. It is a message queue on which you place messages for processing by application components. In this case you can process each data processing part in separate ECS tasks and have them write an Amazon SQS queue. That way the backend can pick up the messages from the queue when theyâ€™re ready and there is no delay due to the second part not being complete.

**CORRECT:** "Process each part using a separate ECS task. Create an Amazon SQS queue" is the correct answer.

**INCORRECT:** "Process both parts using the same ECS task. Create an Amazon Kinesis Firehose stream" is incorrect. Amazon Kinesis Firehose is used for streaming data. This is not an example of streaming data. In this case SQS is better as a message can be placed on a queue to indicate that the job is complete and ready to be picked up by the backend application component.

**INCORRECT:** "Process each part using a separate ECS task. Create an Amazon SNS topic and send a notification when the processing completes" is incorrect. Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) can be used for sending notifications. It is useful when you need to notify multiple AWS services. In this case an Amazon SQS queue is a better solution as there is no mention of multiple AWS services and this is an ideal use case for SQS.

**INCORRECT:** "Create an Amazon DynamoDB table and save the output of the first part to the table" is incorrect. Amazon DynamoDB is unlikely to be a good solution for this requirement. There is a limit on the maximum amount of data that you can store in an entry in a DynamoDB table.

i still have not understood the usage of SQS in real world situation.

cant understand shit type of questions:


You are establishing a monitoring solution for desktop systems, that will be sending telemetry data into AWS every 1 minute. Data for each system must be processed in order, independently, and you would like to scale the number of consumers to be possibly equal to the number of desktop systems that are being monitored.

What do you recommend?

You need order
messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.

**Use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue, and make sure the telemetry data is sent with a Group ID attribute representing the value of the Desktop ID**

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.

We, therefore, need to use an SQS FIFO queue. If we don't specify a GroupID, then all the messages are in absolute order, but we can only have 1 consumer at most. To allow for multiple consumers to read data for each Desktop application, and to scale the number of consumers, we should use the "Group ID" attribute. So this is the correct option.

Incorrect options:

**Use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue, and send the telemetry data as is** - This is incorrect because if we send the telemetry data as is then we will not be able to scale the number of consumers to be equal to the number of desktop systems. In this case, each message will have its consumer. So we should use the "Group ID" attribute so that multiple consumers can read data for each Desktop application.

**Use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue, and send the telemetry data as is** - An Amazon SQS standard queue has no ordering capability so that's ruled out.

**Use an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream, and send the telemetry data with a Partition ID that uses the value of the Desktop ID** - Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events. A Kinesis Data Stream would work and would give us the data for each desktop application within shards, but we can only have as many consumers as shards in Kinesis (which is in practice, much less than the number of producers).
