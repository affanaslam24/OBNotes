#### **Option 1: Separate FIFO queues, with short/long polling**

- FIFO ensures **order**, not **priority**.
    
- **Polling type (short vs long)** doesn‚Äôt give strict control over job prioritization.
    
- This doesn't guarantee **paid jobs are processed first**.
    

#### ‚ùå **Option 2: One standard queue, batching + short polling**

- **Single queue** means **no real control** over job priority.
    
- Batching won‚Äôt guarantee **paid jobs are picked before free**.
    
- Still susceptible to free jobs being processed before paid ones.
    

#### ‚ùå **Option 3: One FIFO queue with priority**

- **SQS FIFO doesn‚Äôt support priority** natively.
    
- There‚Äôs **no built-in way** to reorder or prioritize messages by type in a FIFO queue.
    

#### ‚úÖ **Option 4: Separate Standard queues, prioritize polling**

- **Best fit**.
    
- Two queues: one for **paid**, one for **free**.
    
- EC2 instances can **poll the paid queue first** and only check the free queue when the paid one is empty.
    
- Gives **maximum flexibility** and control.

### üß† Real-World Analogy:

Imagine two customer service lines:

- One for VIPs (paid users), one for regulars (free).
    
- You assign more agents or faster service to the VIP line. That‚Äôs what this solution achieves.
