## Two Ways to Integrate External IdPs in AWS Cognito

|Method|Description|When to Use|
|---|---|---|
|üîπ **User Pool Federation**|Let users sign in to Cognito _User Pool_ via Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.|If you only need user auth and not AWS resource access|
|üîπ **Identity Pool Federation**|Use external IdPs (Google, SAML, etc.) _directly_ in Identity Pool|If you want to give users AWS credentials to access resources like S3 directly|


### Option 1: **User Pool Federation (Recommended for Most Apps)**

If you only need to authenticate users and call your backend API (via API Gateway, Lambda), **this is the best option**.

#### ‚ú® How It Works:

- Cognito User Pool acts as the central user directory.
- You integrate Google / Facebook as a _federated identity provider_.
- The user logs in via Google.
- Cognito issues standard JWT tokens (`ID`, `Access`, `Refresh`).

#### üß± Steps:

1. **Go to User Pools ‚Üí Federation ‚Üí Identity Providers**
2. Choose **Google**
3. Enter:
    - Client ID
    - Client Secret
        
4. Set up **Attribute Mapping**
    
    - Map `email`, `name`, etc.
5. Go to **App Client Settings**
    
    - Enable Google as a provider
    - Set callback/logout URLs
        
6. Now, users can log in via Google through a **hosted UI link**, or you can implement a custom front-end.





### Option 2: **Identity Pool Federation (for AWS resource access)**

If you want users who sign in with Google to also **upload to S3 or access AWS services from the frontend**, you can federate Google into **Cognito Identity Pools**.

#### ‚ú® How It Works:

- The user logs in with Google via Google OAuth
    
- You pass their `id_token` to Cognito Identity Pool
    
- Cognito verifies the token and exchanges it for **temporary AWS credentials**
    
- You can now access AWS services directly
    

This flow usually bypasses the User Pool entirely, unless you integrate both together.



## Which One Should You Use?

|You Want...|Use|
|---|---|
|Social login only (Google, Facebook) and backend API calls|**User Pool federation**|
|Social login and **direct access to AWS services from frontend** (S3 uploads, etc.)|**Identity Pool federation**|
|Both social login and AWS access, managed together|Use **User Pool + Identity Pool** combo|



So, we would need to configure both the user pool as well as identity pool in such a way that they dont crrste a mess:


## How It Works ‚Äì High Level Flow:

1. **User signs in** with Google or Facebook (via Cognito **User Pool**)
    
2. Cognito User Pool issues a JWT (`id_token`)
    
3. You pass the token to a **Cognito Identity Pool**
    
4. Identity Pool verifies the token, then returns:
    
    - AWS credentials (via STS)
        
5. User can now directly access AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, etc.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### ‚úÖ 1. **Set up Cognito User Pool**

- Create a **User Pool**
- Add **Identity Providers** like Google, Facebook under `Federation > Identity Providers`
- Set up **App Client** and Hosted UI (optional)
- Enable attribute mapping


### 2. **Create Cognito Identity Pool**

- Go to **Cognito > Federated Identities**
- Choose **"Create new identity pool"**
- Enable **"Authentication providers" ‚Üí Cognito**
    
    - Provide **User Pool ID**
    - Provide **App Client ID**

üîÅ You can also add **Google / Facebook directly here**, but since you‚Äôre already using them via User Pool, we let Identity Pool **federate via User Pool**
### the above line is crucial. You couldve created a particular google or facebook ones, but were using user pool.



### **Configure IAM Roles**

- Identity Pool will create 2 roles:
    
    - **Authenticated role**: For logged-in users
        
    - **Unauthenticated role**: (optional)
        
- Attach permissions like `s3:PutObject`, `dynamodb:Query`, etc. to Authenticated role




The workflow:

  User 
    |
    | logs in via Google/Facebook
    v
 Cognito User Pool   ‚Üê (Federated IdPs like Google/Facebook configured here)
    |
    | gives id_token (JWT)
    v
 Cognito Identity Pool   ‚Üê (connected to User Pool)
    |
    | exchanges token for temporary AWS credentials
    v
 IAM Role via STS 
    |
    v
 Access AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
