Data in stored format is encrypted at rest.
Data in  transfer format is encrypted at transfer.

### Key Concept

we use the key and an algo to encrypt the plaintext and form a ciphertext. Plaintext is anything.

### Assymetric encription
it is heavy on the system

This uses both public and private key.
The cat ruler takes the public key of the general and makes a cipher text, and then sends it to the robot general who uses his private key to decrypt.

Now this is heavy, so we need to find a way to make this into symmetric encryption which is where both sides have one key and they use for enxryptionn and decryption.
And to achieve that, we use signing:

Now, we will research this topic properly and get back here.
