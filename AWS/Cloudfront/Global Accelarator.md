- what is global accelarator?
- its a service by aws which uses its personal fibre connections to provide fast delivery of data to vaeious network.
- It is used, when you access a website or something, it find the closest edge location and thorugh that sends the data to the global accelarator fibre connection.
Why do we need this? 
because in normal routing, there are numerous hops, and more hops means worser qualitty of the content, and you dont want to corrupt your content.
And global accelarator provides this, it uses a direct connection through its fibre connection.

Also, it uses anycast ips.
What is Anycast IP?
- usually a single instance is attached to unicast ip, meaning single ip for single device, but with Anycast ip we can attach one ip to more than one Ip. And this makes the global accelarator flexible, beause you get 2 anycast ip, which are attached to different global accelarator, and this can be flexibly interchanged in bw=etween or whatever.



## Difference between global accelarator and cloudfrotn:
- **both provide speed optimisation**, but cloudfront caches the content, meanwhile global accelarator brings the network closer!!

- global accelaratpr uses tcp udp connecion, mesnwile cloudfront uses http/s connection.
