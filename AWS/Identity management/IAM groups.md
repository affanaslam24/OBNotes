cannot have more than 300 groups.
cant have nested.
can make a group of all the existing users, but thats similar to having no group.
Gropu policies and seperate user policies merge to form the deny allow deny rule.

There was a good trick question about grooups jsut having a set of users whcih groups the users, and has a policy attached to it, but it is different from users or something.

Principal are used in resource policy to grant or deny access to specific users. And there the groups CANNOT be referenced.
THIS IS VERY CRUUCAL DIFFERENCE.
