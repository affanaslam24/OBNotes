Notice the null in the first version, but as the version gets added, a newer id gets allocated. And from then on, each object is called using the version id.

When you try to delete a SPECIFIC image that had versions of it, just a deletion marker is added to it. and both the version is hidden.
But you CAN delete the versioned object along with the delete marker. HOW? i forgot, but you might need to specifically choose them and delete.
