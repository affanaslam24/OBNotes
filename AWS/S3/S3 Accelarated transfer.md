**Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) to enable faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket**

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Amazon S3TA takes advantage of Amazon CloudFrontâ€™s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.



**The junior scientist does not need to pay any transfer charges for the image upload**

There are no S3 data transfer charges when data is transferred in from the internet. Also with S3TA, you pay only for transfers that are accelerated. Therefore the junior scientist does not need to pay any transfer charges for the image upload because S3TA did not result in an accelerated transfer.
