so you get the url with the same acess as the identity thats making the url.
if in between the usage of the url, the access of the identity gets compromised for that particular onject, then the url also shows access denied..

similarly, you can create urls even 8if the object doesnt exist, or even if oyu dont have aceess to view it, but in both cases the object will not be visible through the url.

Why presigned url?
