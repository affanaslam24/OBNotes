how does identity policies Affect things. and how does a resource policy effect things?

resource policy are basically who can make use of the resources. Identity policy is basically which resources a user or role are authorised. identity policy is attached to identity, bucket policy is attached to the buckets.

is there something like a bucket security and a different object security?
