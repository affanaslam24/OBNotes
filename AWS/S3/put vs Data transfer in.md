### 🔁 **PUT Request vs. Data Transfer In** — What's the Difference?

#### ✅ 1. **PUT Request**

- **Means:** You told S3 to store a file (object).
    
- **Covers:** The **API operation** — metadata processing, indexing, versioning (if enabled).
    
- **Charged as:**  
    `PUT/COPY/POST/LIST Request` fee  
    ≈ **$0.005 per 1,000 requests** (depending on region and storage class)
    

---

#### ✅ 2. **Data Transfer In (Upload)**

- **Means:** Actual bytes are being sent **into AWS S3** from your device, app, or server.
    
- **Covers:** The **network bandwidth** used to move the file into the S3 service.
    
- **Cost:**  
    ✅ **FREE** — _Data transferred **into S3 from the internet** is always free._

### 📦 Analogy:

> Think of it like mailing a package to a warehouse:

- **PUT request** = you telling the warehouse, “Hey, I’m sending a box, please store it under ‘Shoes/March2025’. Here's the label and barcode.”
    
- **Data transfer in** = the truck actually carrying that box into the warehouse.

### 💡 TL;DR:

|Aspect|PUT Request|Data Transfer In|
|---|---|---|
|What it is|API call to upload/store an object|Network data flowing into S3|
|Charged?|Yes (per 1,000 requests)|Free (from internet to S3)|
|Example|`PUT /myfile.jpg`|Sending 5MB of file content|

### ⚙️ What is “Data Transfer” in AWS?

In AWS, **data transfer** refers to the **movement of actual bytes over the network** — like downloading, uploading, or syncing files **into or out of AWS services**.

It’s different from making an **API request**, which is just a command (like saying “PUT this file here”).

---

### 📦 Let’s take your example:

> “A junior scientist uploads a 3GB image using S3 Transfer Acceleration…”

Here’s how AWS sees it:

#### ✅ 1. **PUT Request:**

This is the **API command**:

> `PUT /nasa-images/nebula.jpg`  
> It tells S3: “Hey, I want to upload this file and store it here.”

✅ You’re charged for this **API call**.  
💰 Example: `$0.005 per 1,000 PUT requests`

---

#### ✅ 2. **Data Transfer In (Using S3 Transfer Acceleration):**

This is the **actual 3 GB of image data** moving through AWS’s edge network into S3.

- ✅ If you're uploading **from the internet**, this 3 GB **data transfer IN** is **free** — **even with Transfer Acceleration**.
    
- ❗But if you're uploading **from another AWS region** or **using special acceleration features**, you **might get charged** for **Transfer Acceleration**, even if the data transfer itself is "free".

### 🧠 So how do you know if it’s about PUT or Data Transfer?

|You're talking about...|If the focus is on...|Example from your case|
|---|---|---|
|**PUT request**|The **command/API call** to upload|The scientist calling `PUT` to S3|
|**Data transfer**|The **movement of 3GB** from their laptop to S3|The actual image bytes moving in|

---

### 🧪 In your specific scenario:

> “S3TA did not result in an accelerated transfer”

This part is talking about the **data transfer**, not the PUT.

💡 **Why?** Because Transfer Acceleration is about **speeding up the network transfer**, not the API request processing.

---

### 🔁 Summary:

- **PUT request** = Command to upload — you're charged for the API request.
    
- **Data Transfer In** = The actual 3GB of data going into S3 — often free, but Transfer Acceleration may still have **extra charges for speed**.
