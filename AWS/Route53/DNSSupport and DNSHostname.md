| Setting                | Default when creating a **default VPC** | Default when creating a **custom VPC**                      |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **enableDnsSupport**   | ✅ Yes (enabled)                         | ✅ Yes (enabled)                                             |
| **enableDnsHostnames** | ✅ Yes (enabled)                         | ❌ No (disabled) — **you must enable it manually** if needed |

So:

- **Custom VPCs**: `enableDnsHostnames` is **disabled by default**, even though `enableDnsSupport` is **enabled**.
    
- If you need DNS resolution (especially for EC2 hostnames or private hosted zones), **you must manually enable `enableDnsHostnames`**.


🔥 **Important:** If `enableDnsSupport = false`, Route 53 private zone will **not work** even if associated correctly with the VPC — because DNS isn’t functional at all.

## 🔧 1. `enableDnsSupport`

### 🔍 What it does:

This controls whether **Amazon-provided DNS** is **enabled** for your VPC.

### ✅ If set to **`true`**:

- Your VPC can **resolve DNS names** using the AWS internal DNS server at IP `169.254.169.253`.
    
- You can resolve:
    
    - Route 53 records
        
    - AWS service endpoints (`ec2.amazonaws.com`)
        
    - Private hosted zones, etc.
        

### ❌ If set to **`false`**:

- **No DNS resolution** inside the VPC.
    
- Even internal AWS service names won’t resolve.

## 🏷️ 2. `enableDnsHostnames`

### 🔍 What it does:

Controls whether **EC2 instances** launched in the VPC are **assigned DNS hostnames**.

### ✅ If set to **`true`**:

- EC2 instances get a DNS hostname like:  
    `ip-172-31-16-25.us-west-2.compute.internal`
    
- Public IPs (if assigned) get public DNS names too.
    

### ❌ If set to **`false`**:

- EC2 instances only get **IP addresses**, no DNS names.
    

> 💡 This setting has **no effect on DNS resolution** itself — only on whether instances are given DNS names.

## 🧠 TL;DR – Quick Analogy:

|Option|Think of it as|Without it|
|---|---|---|
|`enableDnsSupport`|**“Enable DNS server”**|No DNS resolution at all|
|`enableDnsHostnames`|**“Assign DNS names to instances”**|EC2s have no DNS names, just IPs|

---

## 🏨 Imagine your VPC as a hotel:

### - `enableDnsSupport`:

This is like **installing a phone line system** in the hotel.

- ✅ **Enabled**: The hotel rooms (your EC2 instances) can **call each other by room number** (DNS name), and they can **call reception** (AWS services like `ec2.amazonaws.com`, Route 53, etc.)
    
- ❌ **Disabled**: There’s **no internal phone system**. Even if rooms have phones (hostnames), they can't use them. DNS lookups just fail.
    

---

### - `enableDnsHostnames`:

This is like giving each hotel room a **visible room number plate** (DNS name).

- ✅ **Enabled**: EC2 instances **get DNS names**, like `ip-10-0-0-1.ec2.internal`. If they also have public IPs, they get public DNS names too.
    
- ❌ **Disabled**: Instances have **no nameplate**, just an IP address. Even though the hotel can route calls (DNS is working), there's **no name** to call this room.

## 🎯 When You Need Them:

|Use Case|Need `enableDnsSupport`?|Need `enableDnsHostnames`?|
|---|---|---|
|DNS resolution inside VPC|✅ Yes|❌ Not needed|
|Assigning DNS names to EC2|✅ Yes|✅ Yes|
|Using Route 53 private hosted zone|✅ Yes|❌ Not needed|
|Resolving AWS service endpoints|✅ Yes|❌ Not needed|
|Giving EC2 public DNS names|✅ Yes|✅ Yes (only works in public subnets with IGW)|

---

## ✅ Final Summary:

|Setting|What it does|When to enable|
|---|---|---|
|`enableDnsSupport`|Turns on DNS resolution in the VPC|Always enable unless you want to **completely block** DNS|
|`enableDnsHostnames`|Gives DNS names to your EC2s|Enable if your EC2s **need hostnames**, private or public|

## 🧠 Real-Life Scenario:

Imagine this:

- You have a VPC with a **private hosted zone** called `internal.myapp.com`.
    
- You add a record: `api.internal.myapp.com → 10.0.1.25`.
    
- You want your EC2 instances to use `api.internal.myapp.com` instead of the IP.
    

✅ For this to work:

1. VPC must have `enableDnsSupport = true` → allows DNS to function.
    
2. VPC must be associated with the **Private Hosted Zone**.
    
3. EC2 instance must be in that VPC.
    
4. `enableDnsHostnames` = optional — only matters if you want EC2s to have names.
