**Use AWS Application Migration Service to replicate the VMs to AWS. Install the AWS Replication Agent on each VM:** This is correct because AWS Application Migration Service enables lift-and-shift migrations by replicating VMs from the on-premises data center to AWS. Installing the Replication Agent is the first step to initiate data replication.

**Complete the initial data replication from the VMs to AWS. Launch test instances to perform acceptance tests for the workloads:** This is correct because testing the replicated workloads ensures the migrated VMs function as expected on AWS before the final cutover.

**Stop all operations on the VMs. Perform a cutover by launching the migrated instances in AWS:** This is correct because stopping operations ensures a clean cutover process, allowing the organization to launch the migrated instances in AWS with minimal disruption to business operations.
