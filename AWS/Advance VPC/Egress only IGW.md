Why this?

- so that ipv6 gets an only outbound type of connection.

- architecturally its the same as IGW, it stays connected to the VPC, and is HA across all the AZs of the VPC.
- Instances with IPv6 can get connected to the EO-IGW, a=and the EO-IGW transfers this cobnnection to the IGW of the vpc.
- note that the route table needs to be updated to route to EO-IGW as target, and from Eo_igw to the igw.





A **NAT Gateway** (Network Address Translation Gateway) allows **instances in a private subnet** to **initiate outbound connections** to the **public internet** (e.g., downloading updates, hitting APIs, etc.) **but prevents the internet from initiating connections to them**.


### Analogy:

Think of the NAT Gateway like a **one-way mirror or outbound proxy**:
- **Inside can see out**
- **Outside can’t see in**

So, **you (as a user)** from the internet **cannot send traffic to instances in a private subnet** via the NAT Gateway.


## Do Public and Private Subnets Talk to Each Other Without NAT?

**Yes!** Absolutely.

> Inside a VPC, subnets (public or private) **can always talk to each other**, as long as:
- They are in the **same VPC** (or connected via peering)
- Their **security groups and NACLs allow** the communication    

**NAT Gateway is NOT required** for communication **within** the VPC.


So what is NAT used for? for updating the server or anything. 



## NAT Gateway vs Internet Gateway

|Feature|**NAT Gateway**|**Internet Gateway (IGW)**|
|---|---|---|
|For outbound traffic?|Yes (for private instances)|Yes (for public instances)|
|For inbound traffic?|❌ No (blocks unsolicited traffic)|✅ Yes (if public IP or ELB is attached)|
|IP type used?|Public IP (Elastic IP)|Public IP or assigned by AWS|
|Placed in subnet?|Public subnet|Attached to VPC|
|Supports IPv4?|✅ Yes|✅ Yes|
|Supports IPv6?|❌ No (Use EOIGW for IPv6)|✅ Yes|

Private Instance (10.0.2.10) 
   |
   |  → wants to update OS from internet
   ↓
Route Table (0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway)
   ↓
NAT Gateway (has Elastic IP)
   ↓
Internet Gateway
   ↓
Internet
   ↑
   ← response comes back




So basically, using nat, i will not be able to access or ping the private instance no matter what.

### **No Inbound Route**

- Even if you had the NAT, the route table in the private subnet **doesn't allow incoming connections** from the internet.
    
- Only **Internet Gateway** can handle inbound + outbound, but that requires a public IP on the instance.
- Key difference between IGW and NAT


If you still want to access the instanc efrom innside  you will need 2 options:
- Use bastion hosts or jumboxes.
- Use sessions manager.




## Why did we talk about NAt in so much consideration? because Egress oonly is like nat
