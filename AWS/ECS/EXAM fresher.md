- With the Fargate launch type, you pay for the amount of vCPU and memory resources that your containerized application requests. vCPU and memory resources are calculated from the time your container images are pulled until the Amazon ECS Task terminates, rounded up to the nearest second. With the EC2 launch type, there is no additional charge for the EC2 launch type. You pay for AWS resources (e.g. EC2 instances or EBS volumes) you create to store and run your application.
