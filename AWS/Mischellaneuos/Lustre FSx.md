**Amazon FSx for Lustre**

Amazon FSx for Lustre makes it easy and cost-effective to launch and run the world’s most popular high-performance file system. It is used for workloads such as machine learning, high-performance computing (HPC), video processing, and financial modeling. The open-source Lustre file system is designed for applications that require fast storage – where you want your storage to keep up with your compute. FSx for Lustre integrates with Amazon S3, making it easy to process data sets with the Lustre file system. When linked to an S3 bucket, an FSx for Lustre file system transparently presents S3 objects as files and allows you to write changed data back to S3.

FSx for Lustre provides the ability to both process the 'hot data' in a parallel and distributed fashion as well as easily store the 'cold data' on Amazon S3. Therefore this option is the BEST fit for the given problem statement.

**Amazon FSx works natively with Amazon S3**, making it easy to access your S3 data to run data processing workloads. Your S3 objects are presented as files in your file system, and you can write your results back to S3. This lets you run data processing workloads on FSx for Lustre and store your long-term data on S3 or on-premises data stores.



FSx lustre works natively with S3!!!
