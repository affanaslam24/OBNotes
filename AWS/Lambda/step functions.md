- states are tihngs inside the workflows, they process the data, they work with it, and give an output. 
- standard for long running workflows. And express for upto 5 minutes, immediate transactional based workflows.
-  how does it work? by services, rules, or you can do it manually as well


states thw **THINGS** which occur

i couldnt understand map and task, buyt others are:
- choice is an input that you give and it takes that choice.
- some choices can make it such that more than one task is being done at the same time.

To understand more about tasks - [[task]].

So task is what connects with other external services to complete that task. states itself cant complete the work, they needs to join hands with the services, and task is what connects them to it.


Q. does step function has the cold and warm issue that a lambda has? becasue eventually in some states it is calling a lambda function lets say every 15 minutes?
->
**Step Functions itself does _not_ have cold start issues.**  
But ‚Äî when it calls a **Lambda function**, the **Lambda still behaves like Lambda**, which means:

> **Yes, the Lambda inside a Step Function can still have cold starts.**

### üí° Here's a breakdown:

| Component            | Cold Start Affected? | Notes                                                                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Step Function**    | ‚ùå No                 | Always warm, managed state engine                                           |
| **Lambda inside it** | ‚úÖ Yes                | Depends on usual Lambda behavior (runtime, memory, provisioned concurrency) |

---

### ‚è± When do cold starts happen in Lambda?

- Function hasn't been invoked in a while (typically ~10‚Äì15 mins)
    
- You're not using **provisioned concurrency**
    
- Larger runtimes (like Java or .NET) take longer
    
- First invocation after deployment
    

So if your Step Function calls Lambda every **15 minutes**, it's very likely that the Lambda may go **cold** between calls.

---

### ‚úÖ Ways to Prevent Cold Starts in Lambda (from Step Functions or anywhere)

1. **Use Provisioned Concurrency**
    
    - Keeps a set number of Lambda instances warm at all times.
        
    - Add it to your Lambda function especially for high-latency sensitive tasks.
        
2. **Use lighter runtimes**
    
    - Node.js and Python cold start faster than Java or .NET.
        
3. **Keep Lambdas active with a "ping"**
    
    - Not ideal or cost-efficient, but sometimes used (ex: CloudWatch cron every 5 mins).

### üß† Bonus Tip: Combine Map with Lambda Carefully

If you're using a **Map** state to invoke a Lambda for each item, **each iteration is a separate Lambda call** ‚Äî so cold starts can be more noticeable if concurrency is high and no provisioned concurrency is set.
