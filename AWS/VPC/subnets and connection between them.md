what if both of them are in the same vpc bbut one is public and the other is private?

###### ChatGPT said:

If **both instances are in the same VPC**, but one is in a **public subnet** and the other in a **private subnet**, they **can still communicate** **internally** as long as their **route tables, security groups, and NACLs allow it**.

## ‚úÖ **When Can They Communicate?**

1. **Using Private IPs (VPC Internal Communication) ‚Üí YES**
    
    - Since both instances are in the **same VPC**, they can communicate **using private IP addresses**.
        
    - The **private instance does not need internet access** to communicate with the public instance.
        
    - **Security groups and NACLs must allow the traffic** (e.g., SSH, HTTP, or custom ports).
        
2. **Using Public IP (Private to Public Communication) ‚Üí NO**
    
    - The private instance **cannot** reach the public instance's **public IP** directly because it **does not have internet access**.
        
    - However, if a **NAT Gateway** is set up, the private instance **can reach the public internet**.

## ‚ùå **When Can‚Äôt They Communicate?**

- If **security groups** or **NACLs** block communication.
    
- If the **private subnet's route table does not have a route** for the public subnet.
    
- If the private instance tries to use the **public instance‚Äôs public IP** (instead of the private IP).

## **üöÄ Best Practice: Use Private IP for Internal Communication**

If you want them to communicate, make sure to use **private IP addresses** rather than public IPs. Just ensure:  
‚úÖ **Security groups** allow traffic between them.  
‚úÖ **NACLs** do not block the communication.  
‚úÖ **Route tables** allow internal routing within the VPC.
